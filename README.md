# ClassSearch
The aim of this application is to provide a friendlier mobile interface for searching classes at the University of Virginia. Current options include SIS Mobile or Lou's List. SIS Mobile does not have the same functionality as Lou's List and is a webapp, whereas Lou's List does not include a mobile version.
